# SMS Reminder System: A/B Test Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To simulate and analyze the impact of sending SMS reminders on member contribution behavior in a Chama setup.

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
- **Simulated data** of 300 members over 3 months
- **Group A**: Received SMS reminders
- **Group B**: No reminders (control group)

Dataset fields:
- `member_id`, `group`, `due_date`, `payment_date`, `days_late`, `is_late`, `amount`

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Summary
| Metric               | Group A (SMS) | Group B (No SMS) |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Avg Days Late        | 0.02 days     | 1.72 days        |
| Default Rate         | 35%           | 65%              |
| Avg Contribution     | KES 3,512     | KES 3,305        |

## âœ… Conclusion
The analysis supports investing in an SMS reminder system:
- Reduced payment lateness
- Lower default rates
- Higher average contributions
